I have completed my Batchelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology(RUET).</br>

</br>I hope to carry out research on adversarial machine learning, lightweight machine learning algorithms, multi-modal and cross-modal learning, continual learning algorithms, and machine learning model transparency. I would want to focus on the following tasks:</br>
</br>1. Research on creating models in the fields of the power sector, finance and healthcare that offer precise justifications for their choices
</br>2. Looking at reliable machine learning models and techniques for identifying and countering adversarial attacks.
</br>3. Developing algorithms and architectures that facilitate continual learning and lifelong adaptation in machine learning systems.
</br>4. Studying cross-modal and multimodal learning for uses in human-computer interaction and multimedia analysis
</br>5. Research machine learning methods that take into consideration edge computing and IoT applications, considering constraints on computation, memory, and energy.
